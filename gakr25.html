  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Is BTech better than BE?</strong>
      <p>Both BTech (Bachelor of Technology) and BE (Bachelor of Engineering) are undergraduate engineering degrees and are considered equivalent by most universities and employers. However, BTech programs are usually more practical and skill-based, while BE may emphasize theoretical and conceptual foundations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Can I do BTech after a diploma?</strong>
      <p>Yes, diploma holders in engineering can pursue BTech through lateral entry, which allows them to join directly in the second year of the program. Entrance exams or merit-based admission processes may apply, depending on the university or state regulations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>What is the average salary after BTech?</strong>
      <p>The average salary depends on the branch, college reputation, and placement opportunities. Typically, graduates earn between ₹3 LPA to ₹8 LPA in core branches. In top institutes like IITs/NITs, salaries can exceed ₹30 LPA, especially in tech or consulting roles.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Is coding necessary for all branches?</strong>
      <p>Coding is essential for branches like Computer Science, Information Technology, and Data Science. For other branches, basic programming knowledge is introduced as part of the curriculum, but advanced coding skills are optional unless you're pursuing tech-focused roles or interdisciplinary careers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Can I pursue higher studies abroad after BTech?</strong>
      <p>Yes, BTech is widely accepted by international universities for postgraduate programs like MS, MBA, or PhDs. Popular destinations include the USA, Canada, Germany, Australia, and the UK. You may need to take exams like GRE, IELTS, or TOEFL depending on the program and country.</p>
